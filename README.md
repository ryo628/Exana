------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please check [ExanaPkg](https://github.com/YukinoriSato/ExanaPkg), a packaged version (pre-compiled into binary code) with utility tools.

Currently, Exana provide the following functions:
* LCCT (Loop and call context tree)
* LCCT+M (Loop and call context tree with memory dataflow)
* MemPat (Memory access pattern analysis)
* Working set analysis
* C2Sim (Advanced cache simulation with line-conflict detection, see [EuroPar 2017])


## How to build
* Download Pin tool kit Intel64 linux.

    For information about Pin tool kit, please check:
    	http://pintool.org/ 
    Here, Exana is verified using Pin 3.4 rev 97438 for Intel64 linux on CentOS 7.  (For Pin-2.x and CentOS 6, please use the previous version uploaded on Sep 2017.)

* Unpack the pin-3.4-97438-gf90d1f746-gcc-linux
* cd pin-3.4/source/tools
* git clone https://github.com/YukinoriSato/Exana.git
* cd Exana
* make


## How to run
Run Exana with your target:
* pin -t obj-intel64/Exana.so -- ./a.out [input.dat]

ExanaPkg is provided as an utility for Exana.
For more details, please check HowToUse in ExanaPkg.
